Run started on 2024-01-20 17:54:24 . 

Random numbers initialised with seed: 3178 .

Fitting star id: 427224073427887360 .
* Using the grid '/root/BASTA/grids/Garstec_AS09_barbieMS.hdf5' of type 'sobol tracks'.
  - Grid built with BASTA version 1.3.1, timestamp: 2023-11-28 at 20:12:28.

Transforming solar-based asteroseismic quantities:
* Converting to solar units if needed...
* Solar model scaling not activated!  -->  Dnu will not be scaled.
Done!

Fitting information:
* Fitting parameters with values and uncertainties:
  - Teff: [3399.8037, 1.9827]
  - FeH: [-1.3635, 0.0065]

Additional input parameters and settings in alphabetical order:
* asciiparams: ['Teff', 'FeH', 'radPhot', 'massfin', 'age']
* centroid: median
* cornerplots: ['Teff', 'FeH', 'radPhot', 'massfin', 'age']
* dnu_scales: {}
* dnusun: 135.1
* freqplots: []
* inputfile: input_JustKen.xml
* kielplots: [True]
* numsun: 3090.0
* output: mnt/c/Users/georg/Documents/GitHub/Iwan-and-George-Year-4-Project/Results/
* plotfmt: png
* solarmodel: False
* uncert: quantiles

Weights and priors:
* Bayesian weights:
  - Along tracks: age
  - Between tracks: volume
* Flat, constrained priors and ranges:
  - Teff: [3393.8556, 3405.7518]
  - FeH: [-1.6135, -1.1135]
* Additional priors (IMF):
